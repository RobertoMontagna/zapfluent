# Development Guidelines

> This project is actively developed with the assistance of Google Jules, an AI-powered software engineer.

These principles are language-agnostic and form the core philosophy of writing clean, maintainable code.

This document serves as a table of contents for our development guidelines. Please read these documents to understand the coding standards and best practices for this project.

## Guideline Hierarchy

The guidelines are organized into a clear hierarchy. When rules conflict, more specific files take precedence over more general ones. The order of priority is as follows:

1.  **Repository-Specific Guidelines**: Highest priority. These rules are tailored for this project and override any other guidelines.
2.  **Go-Specific Guidelines**: These apply to all Go code and are more specific than the general principles.
3.  **General Principles**: Lowest priority. These are universal, language-agnostic principles that form the foundation of our coding philosophy.

The SonarQube Rules file is a reference for specific linting rules and should be considered a set of additional constraints.
